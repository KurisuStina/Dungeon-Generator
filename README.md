# Dungeon-Generator
Basic dungeon generator for Unity using procedural generation

Current Version requires use of two prefabs:
One for the room itself, another for the connecting corridors.
**Currently, to change the size of the rooms, you have to manually change the scale of the prefab in Unity inspector.
